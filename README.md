# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning and Evaluation Modes



---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **smart Tic-Tac-Toe AI** that can play against a human player using:

- **Alpha-Beta pruning** for efficient move search
- Two evaluation modes:
  - **Classical heuristic evaluation** (hand-coded)
  - **Machine-learned evaluation** using a trained ML model

The game provides a **professional GUI** with **responsive design**, allowing users to choose difficulty, evaluation method, and player side.
